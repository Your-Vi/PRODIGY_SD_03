How It Works:

    1.Contacts are stored in a contacts.json file for persistence.
    2.Users can add, view, edit, and delete contacts using simple menu-based navigation.
    3.Editing allows modifying only specific fields without re-entering all details.
    4.Data is stored in JSON format, making it easy to load and modify.
